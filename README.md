# DiscordFileStorage

WIP web application for sharing files (videos mostly) on Discord. Contains simple website where users can login with their discord account. "Upload" page is for selecting Discord channel and uploading file, Discord bot will then automatically send a link to this file to selected channel. If uploaded file was a video, app will convert it so other members of your server can play it directly in chat channel. "File management" is for managing files - users can view file's page, resend file or delete it.
